The majority of fatalities occur in low- and middle-income countries, particularly among vulnerable road users. These accidents not only lead to human suffering but also impose a significant economic burden on individuals, families, and nations. Thailand, in particular, has a high rate of road traffic deaths, with a significant portion of accidents occurring on national highways and in designated \"black spots.\"\n\n## Objective\n\nThe objective of this project is to investigate the factors influencing road traffic accidents in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) using spatial and spatio-temporal point pattern analysis.\n\n-   **Visualize spatio-temporal dynamics:** Use statistical graphics and geovisualization methods to depict the distribution of road traffic accidents over time and space.\n\n-   **Conduct spatial analysis:** Employ network-based spatial point pattern analysis methods to examine the spatial distribution of accidents within the road network.\n\n-   **Conduct spatio-temporal analysis:** Utilize temporal network-based spatial point pattern analysis methods to explore the relationship between accidents and both spatial and temporal factors.\n\n## **The Data**\n\nThree basic data sets are used, they are:\n\n-   [Thailand Road Accident \\[2019-2022\\]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thaweewatboy/thailand-road-accident-2019-2022) on Kaggle\n\n-   [Thailand Roads (OpenStreetMap Export)](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_tha_roads) on HDX.\n\n-   [Thailand - Subnational Administrative Boundaries](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-tha?) on HDX.\n\n## Installing and launching the R packages\n\nIn this exercise, four R packages will be used, they are:\n\n-   [spNetwork](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spNetwork/index.html), which provides functions to perform Spatial Point Patterns Analysis such as kernel density estimation (KDE) and K-function on network. It also can be used to build spatial matrices (‘listw’ objects like in ‘spdep’ package) to conduct any kind of traditional spatial analysis with spatial weights based on reticular distances.\n\n-   [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/index.html) package provides functions to manage, processing, and manipulate **Simple Features**, a formal geospatial data standard that specifies a storage and access model of spatial geometries such as points, lines, and polygons.\n\n-   [tmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/index.html) which provides functions for plotting cartographic quality static point patterns maps or interactive maps by using [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) API.\n\nUse the code chunk below to install and launch the four R packages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf, spNetwork, tmap, tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Data Import and Preparation\n\nSince `acc` data set is in csv file format, we will use [*read_csv()*](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) of **readr** package to import `thai_road_accident_2019_2022.csv` as shown the code chunk below. The output R object is called `acc`.\n\nThe below code reads in a CSV of traffic accidents, filters out rows with missing coordinates, creates new columns for the month and day of the accidents, converts the dataframe to a spatial object, and then transforms the spatial data to a specific CRS for further geospatial analysis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nacc <- read_csv(\"Data/rawdata/thai_road_accident_2019_2022.csv\") %>%\n  filter(!is.na(longitude) & !is.na(latitude)) %>%   # Filter out rows with missing coordinates\n  mutate(Month_num = month(incident_datetime)) %>%\n  mutate(Month_fac = month(incident_datetime, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)) %>%\n  mutate(dayofweek = day(incident_datetime)) %>%\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"), crs = 4326) %>%  # Specify the CRS\n  st_transform(crs = 32647)  # Transform to your desired CRS\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwrite_rds(acc, \"Data/rds/acc.rds\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nacc <- read_rds(\"Data/rds/acc.rds\")\n```\n:::\n",
