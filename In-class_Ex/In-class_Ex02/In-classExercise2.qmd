## Installing and Loading the R packages

In this hands-on exercise, five R packages will be used, they are:

-   [**sf**](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/), a relatively new R package specially designed to import, manage and process vector-based geospatial data in R.

-   [**spatstat**](https://spatstat.org/), which has a wide range of useful functions for point pattern analysis. In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to perform 1st- and 2nd-order spatial point patterns analysis and derive kernel density estimation (KDE) layer.

-   [**raster**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/) which reads, writes, manipulates, analyses and model of gridded spatial data (i.e. raster). In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to convert image output generate by spatstat into raster format.

-   [**maptools**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maptools/index.html) which provides a set of tools for manipulating geographic data. In this hands-on exercise, we mainly use it to convert *Spatial* objects into *ppp* format of **spatstat**.

-   [**tmap**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/index.html) which provides functions for plotting cartographic quality static point patterns maps or interactive maps by using [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) API.

Use the code chunk below to install and launch the five R packages.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, raster, spatstat, tmap, tidyverse)
```

## Issue 1: Installing maptools

**maptools** is retired and binary is removed from CRAN. However, we can download from [Posit Public Package Manager](https://packagemanager.posit.co/client/#/repos/cran/setup?snapshot=2023-10-13&distribution=windows&r_environment=ide) snapshots by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("maptools", 
                 repos = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2023-10-13")
```

After the installation is completed, it is important to edit the code chunk as shown below in order to avoid **maptools** being download and install repetitively every time the Quarto document been rendered.

## Issue 2: Creating coastal outline

In **sf** package, there are two functions allow us to combine multiple simple features into one simple features. They are [`st_combine()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_combine.html) and `st_union()`.

-   `st_combine()` returns a single, combined geometry, with no resolved boundaries; returned geometries may well be invalid.

-   If y is missing, `st_union(x)` returns a single geometry with resolved boundaries, else the geometries for all unioned pairs of x\[i\] and y\[j\].

### Importing the spatial data

In this section, [*st_read()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/st_read.html) of **sf** package will be used to import these three geospatial data sets into R.

```{r}
childcare_sf <- st_read("C:/gniyuy/ISSS626_GA/Hands-on_Ex/Hands-on_Ex02/Data/child-care-services-geojson.geojson") %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

```{r}
sg_sf <- st_read(dsn = "C:/gniyuy/ISSS626_GA/Hands-on_Ex/Hands-on_Ex02/Data/", layer="CostalOutline")
```

```{r}
mpsz_sf <- st_read(dsn = "C:/gniyuy/ISSS626_GA/Hands-on_Ex/Hands-on_Ex02/Data/", 
                layer = "MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL")
```

### Working with `st_union()`

The code chunk below, `st_union()`is used to derive the coastal outline sf tibble data.frame.

```{r}
#| eval: false
sg_sf <- mpsz_sf %>%
  st_union()
```

*sg_sf* will look similar to the figure below.

```{r}
#| echo: false
tm_shape(sg_sf) + 
  tm_polygons()
```

## Creating ppp objects from sf data.frame

Instead of using the two steps approaches discussed in Hands-on Exercise 3 to create the **ppp** objects, in this section you will learn how to work with sf data.frame.

::: panel-tabset
### `as.ppp()`

In the code chunk below, [`as.ppp()`](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/spatstat.geom/html/as.ppp.html) of [**spatstat.geom**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatstat.geom/spatstat.geom.pdf) package is used to derive an **ppp** object layer directly from a sf tibble data.frame.

```{r}
childcare_ppp <- as.ppp(childcare_sf)
plot(childcare_ppp)
```

### `summary()`

Next, `summary()` can be used to reveal the properties of the newly created ppp objects.

```{r}
summary(childcare_ppp)
```
:::

## Creating *owin* object from sf data.frame

::: panel-tabset
### `as.owin()`

In the code chunk `as.owin()` of **spatstat.geom** is used to create an **owin** object class from polygon sf tibble data.frame.

```{r}
sg_owin <- as.owin(sg_sf)
plot(sg_owin)
```

### `summary()`

Next, *summary()* function is used to display the summary information of the owin object class.

```{r}
summary(sg_owin)
```
:::

## Combining point events object and owin object

::: panel-tabset
### `The task`

Using the step you learned from Hands-on Exercise 3, create an ppp object by combining childcare_ppp and sg_owin.

### `The code`

```{r}
childcareSG_ppp = childcare_ppp[sg_owin]
```

### `The output`

The output object combined both the point and polygon feature in one ppp object class as shown below.

```{r}
plot(childcareSG_ppp)
```
:::

## Kernel Density Estimation of Spatial Point Event

The code chunk below re-scale the unit of measurement from metre to kilometre before performing KDE.

```{r}
childcareSG_ppp.km <- rescale.ppp(childcareSG_ppp, 
                                  1000, 
                                  "km")

kde_childcareSG_adaptive <- adaptive.density(
  childcareSG_ppp.km, 
  method="kernel")
plot(kde_childcareSG_adaptive)
```

## Kernel Density Estimation

Code chunk shown two different ways to convert KDE output into grid object.

::: panel-tabset
### maptools method

```{r}
par(bg = '#E4D5C9')

gridded_kde_childcareSG_ad <- maptools::as.SpatialGridDataFrame.im(
  kde_childcareSG_adaptive)
spplot(gridded_kde_childcareSG_ad)
```

### spatstat.geom method

```{r}
gridded_kde_childcareSG_ad <- as(
  kde_childcareSG_adaptive,
  "SpatialGridDataFrame")
spplot(gridded_kde_childcareSG_ad)
```
:::

### Rescalling KDE values

In the code chunk below, *rescale.ppp()* is used to covert the unit of measurement from meter to kilometer.

```{r}
childcareSG_ppp.km <- rescale.ppp(childcareSG_ppp, 1000, "km")
```

Now, we can re-run *density()* using the resale data set and plot the output kde map.

```{r}
kde_childcareSG.bw <- density(childcareSG_ppp.km, sigma=bw.diggle, edge=TRUE, kernel="gaussian")
plot(kde_childcareSG.bw)
```

### Converting gridded output into raster

Next, we will convert the gridded kernal density objects into RasterLayer object by using *raster()* of **raster** package.

```{r}
kde_childcareSG_bw_raster <- raster(kde_childcareSG.bw)
```

### Visualising KDE using tmap

The code chunk below is used to plot the output raster by using tmap functions.

```{r}
tm_shape(kde_childcareSG_bw_raster) + 
  tm_raster(palette = "viridis") +
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("right", "bottom"), 
            frame = FALSE,
            bg.color = "#E4D5C9")
```

## Extracting study area using sf objects

::: panel-tabset
### The task

Extract and create an ppp object showing child care services and within Punggol Planning Area

### The code

On the other hand, `filter()` of dplyr package should be used to extract the target planning areas as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
pg_owin <- mpsz_sf %>%
  filter(PLN_AREA_N == "PUNGGOL") %>%
  as.owin()

childcare_pg = childcare_ppp[pg_owin]

plot(childcare_pg)  
```
:::

## Monte Carlo Simulation

::: tip
In order to ensure reproducibility, it is important to include the code chunk below before using `spatstat` functions involving Monte Carlo simulation.
:::

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
```

## Edge correction methods of spatstat

In spatstat, edge correction methods are used to handle biases that arise when estimating spatial statistics near the boundaries of a study region. These corrections are essential for ensuring accurate estimates in spatial point pattern analysis, especially for summary statistics like the K-function, L-function, pair correlation function, etc.

Common Edge Correction Methods in spatstat

-   “none”: No edge correction is applied. This method assumes that there is no bias at the edges, which may lead to underestimation of statistics near the boundaries.

-   “isotropic”: This method corrects for edge effects by assuming that the point pattern is isotropic (uniform in all directions). It compensates for missing neighbors outside the boundary by adjusting the distances accordingly.

-   “translate” (Translation Correction): This method uses a translation correction, which involves translating the observation window so that every point lies entirely within it. The statistic is then averaged over all possible translations.

-   “Ripley” (Ripley’s Correction): Similar to the isotropic correction but specifically tailored for Ripley’s K-function and related functions. It adjusts the expected number of neighbors for points near the edges based on the shape and size of the observation window.

-   “border”: Border correction reduces bias by only considering points far enough from the boundary so that their neighborhood is fully contained within the window. This can be quite conservative but reduces the influence of edge effects.
